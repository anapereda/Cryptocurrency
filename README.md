# Cryptocurrency

This challege we developed an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to classify cryptocurrencies. The data was pre-processed and we dropped al values of currencies that were not trading and did not have an algorithm defined. Then we encoded string variables (algoritm and prooftype), finally used a standard scaler to have simiar values in all our variables. Using PCA we reduced the number of variable to 3, and elbow curve to decide that we wanted 4 classes to classify. There are two grapsh to show the cluster included in the Module 18 challenge code.
